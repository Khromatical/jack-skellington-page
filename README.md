My first website

I'm finally getting around to learning code and this is the end result of following along with a SkillShare class! The class was taught by Rich Armstrong and taught me a lot about how HTML and CSS work together. There's still lots of room to grow though!

I'm also learning how GitHub works through this project. Testing out all the features I can.
